US7298498B2 - Optical property measuring apparatus and optical property measuring method, exposure apparatus and exposure method, and device manufacturing method 
By an insertion/withdrawal mechanism, a wavefront division optical element is inserted to an optical path of a light via an optical system to be examined, or the inserted wavefront division optical element is withdrawn from the optical path. Thus, it becomes possible without using a half mirror to make the light via the optical system to be examined be received at a detector via the wavefront division optical element, or the light via the optical system to be examined be received at the detector without the wavefront division optical element. Therefore, the measurement precision of optical properties obtained based on a detection signal from the detector cannot be deteriorated due to a polarization property existing in the half mirror. Accordingly, optical properties of the optical system to be examined can be detected with high precision.
