US6727980B2 - Apparatus and method for pattern exposure and method for adjusting the apparatus 
A method for performing optical adjustments of an exposure apparatus is based on an exposure apparatus having a light source for generating illumination light for exposure, and illumination optics for irradiating a mask with the illumination light generated from the exposure light source so as to imprint a mask pattern on a substrate base. The apparatus uses a wide bandwidth light source for the exposure light source that produces exposure light and non-exposure light having wavelengths different from those in the exposure light, and optical adjustments for optical components in at least a portion of the illumination optics are performed by using non-exposure light
