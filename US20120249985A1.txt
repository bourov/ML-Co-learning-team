US20120249985A1 - Measurement of an imaging optical system by superposition of patterns 
A device for measuring an imaging optical system, including: a first grating pattern (6), which is positionable in a beam path upstream of the imaging optical system, having a first grating structure (16), a second grating pattern (8), which is positionable in the beam path (4) downstream of the imaging optical system, having a second grating structure (18), and a sensor unit for the spatially resolving measurement of a superposition fringe pattern produced during the imaging of the first grating structure (16) of the first grating pattern (6) onto the second grating structure (18) of the second grating pattern (8). The first grating structure (16) differs in its correction structures (17) from the second grating structure (18).
