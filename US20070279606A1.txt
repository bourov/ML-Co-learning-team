US20070279606A1 - Exposure apparatus, exposure method, and method for producing device 
An exposure apparatus includes a projection optical system which is capable of forming an image of a first pattern in a first exposure area and which is capable of forming an image of a second pattern in a second exposure area, the second pattern being different from the first pattern, and a first detecting system which obtains at least one of position information about the image of the first pattern and position information about the image of the second pattern. A positional relationship between the images of the first and second patterns and a predetermined area on a substrate is adjusted based on a detection result to perform multiple exposure for the predetermined area on the substrate with the images of the first and second patterns. The substrate can be subjected to the multiple exposure efficiently.
