US20050190376A1 - Device and method for the determination of imaging errors and microlithography projection exposure system 
A device, a microlithography projection exposure system, and a method for the determination of imaging errors of an optical imaging system using a radiation-superposition measuring technique which operates with lateral phase offset, having an optical element arranged on the object side of the imaging system, having a first periodic structure on the object side with a predetermined periodicity direction, an optical element arranged on the image side of the imaging system, having a second periodic structure on the image side with a periodicity direction corresponding to the first periodic structure, and a detector to detect the superposition pattern of an image of the first periodic structure with the second periodic structure. The first and/or second periodic structure contains at least three periodic substructures, which are arranged offset relative to one another by a predetermined phase offset in the periodicity direction, and the detector has a plurality of detector elements, the number of which is matched to the number of substructures and/or which respectively have a number of detector surfaces adapted for a predetermined aberration determination. In addition or as an alternative, it is possible to operate with a Moir√© technique which produces a fringe superposition pattern.
