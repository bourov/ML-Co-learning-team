US20060119838A1 - Optical measuring apparatus and operating method for an optical imaging system 
A measuring apparatus for optical, for example interferometric, measurement of an optical imaging system, imaging of a useful pattern in an imaging operation, including a device for production of radiation information, for example interference information, which is indicative of imaging errors, having a mask structure arrangement which contains a measurement pattern, and a device for detection and evaluation of the interference information which is indicative of imaging errors; also a method for operation of the optical imaging system including imaging error correction. The apparatus further includes a heating irradiation arrangement for radiation heating of the optical imaging system during measurement operation such that the heating effect of the radiation which is applied to the optical imaging system to be measured equals, within a tolerance range which can be predetermined, the heating effect of the radiation which is passed through the useful pattern during imaging operation of the optical imaging system.
