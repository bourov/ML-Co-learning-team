US7277182B2 - Apparatus for polarization-specific examination, optical imaging system, and calibration method 
A device for polarization-specific examination of an optical system having a detector part that has polarization detector means for recording the exit state of polarization of radiation emerging from the optical system. Also, an associated optical imaging system, and a calibration method for the device. The device includes a polarization detector with a polarizing grating structure. Provided as an alternative is a device for snapshot polarimetry having a birefringent element and downstream polarizer element that adequately polarizes nonquasi-parallel radiation. The device may be used for determining the influence on the state of polarization of UV radiation by a microlithographic projection objective.
