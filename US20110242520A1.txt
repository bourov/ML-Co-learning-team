US20110242520A1 - Optical properties measurement method, exposure method and device manufacturing method 
An image of a pattern used for measurement formed on a reticle for testing is transferred onto a wafer for testing via a projection optical system, while gradually changing a position in an optical axis direction of the projection optical system. The image of the pattern used for measurement which has been transferred is detected, and an amount corresponding to an expanse of the image of the pattern in a measurement direction is obtained. In this case, four images included in the image of the pattern used for measurement are detected in detection areas, respectively, or in other words, remaining sections except for both ends in a non-measurement direction are detected, and for example, area of the remaining sections is to be obtained as the corresponding amount. Optical properties of the projection optical system are to be obtained, based on the area which has been obtained. Because the area which has been obtained does not have sensitivity to the non-measurement direction, the optical properties of the projection optical system in the measurement direction can be precisely obtained.
