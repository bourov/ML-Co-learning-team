US20120092669A1 - Measurement method and measurement system for measuring birefringence 
A method measuring the birefringence of an object. A measurement beam having a defined input polarization state is generated, the measurement beam being directed onto the object. Polarization properties of the measurement beam after interaction with the object are detected in order to generate polarization measurement values representing an output polarization state of the measurement beam after interaction with the object. The input polarization state of the measurement beam is modulated into at least four different measurement states in accordance with a periodic modulation function of an angle parameter α, and the polarization measurement values associated with the at least four measurement states are processed to form a measurement function dependent on the angle parameter α. A two-wave portion of the measurement function is determined and analysed in order to derive at least one birefringence parameter describing the birefringence, preferably by double Fourier transformation of the measurement function.
