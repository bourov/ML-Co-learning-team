      "Multilayer mirrors are disclosed for use especially in “Extreme Ultraviolet” (“soft X-ray,” or “EUV”) optical systems. Each multilayer mirror includes a stack of alternating layers of a first material and a second material, respectively, to form an EUV-reflective surface. The first material has a refractive index substantially the same as a vacuum, and the second material has a refractive index that differs sufficiently from the refractive index of the first material to render the mirror reflective to EUV radiation. The wavefront profile of EUV light reflected from the surface is corrected by removing (“machining” away) at least one surficial layer of the stack in selected region(s) of the surface of the stack. Machining can be performed such that machined regions have smooth tapered edges rather than abrupt edges. The stack can include first and second layer groups that allow the unit of machining to be very small, thereby improving the accuracy with which wavefront-aberration correction can be conducted. Also disclosed are various at-wavelength techniques for measuring reflected-wavelength profiles of the mirror. The mirror surface can include a cover layer of a durable material having high transparency and that reduces variations in reflectivity of the surface caused by machining the selected regions. \n",

      "The disclosure pertains to microlithography (transfer of a fine pattern by an energy beam to a substrate that is “sensitive” to exposure by the energy beam). Microlithography is a key technology used in the manufacture of microelectronic devices such as integrated circuits, displays, magnetic pickup heads, and micromachines. More specificically, the disclosure pertains to microlithography in which the energy beam is a “soft X-ray” beam (also termed an “extreme ultraviolet” or “EUV” beam), to EUV optical systems in general, and to optical components (specifically reflective elements) used in EUV optical systems. \n",
      "As the size of circuit elements in microelectronic devices (e.g., integrated circuits) has continued to decrease, the inability of optical microlithography (microlithography performed using ultraviolet light) to achieve satisfactory resolution of pattern elements is increasingly apparent. Tichenor et al., Proc. SPIE 2437:292 (1995). \n",
      "Hence, intense effort currently is being expended to develop a practical “next-generation” microlithography technology that can achieve substantially greater resolution than obtainable with optical microlithography. A principal candidate next-generation microlithography involves the use of extreme ultraviolet (“EUV”; also termed “soft X-ray”) radiation as the energy beam. The EUV wavelength range currently being investigated is 11-14 nm, which is substantially shorter than the wavelength range (150-250 nm) of conventional “vacuum” ultraviolet light used in current state-of-the-art optical microlithography. EUV microlithography has the potential to yield an image resolution of less than 70 nm, which is beyond the capacity of conventional optical microlithography. \n",
      "In the EUV wavelength range, the refractive index of substances is very close to unity. Hence, in this wavelength range, conventional optical components that rely upon refraction cannot be used. Consequently, optical elements for use with EUV are limited to reflective elements, such as glancing-incidence mirrors that exploit total reflection from a material having a refractive index slightly less than unity, and “multilayer” mirrors. The latter achieve a high overall reflectivity by aligning and superposing the phases of weakly reflected light from the respective interfaces of multiple thin layers, wherein the weakly reflected fields add constructively at certain angles (producing a Bragg effect). For example, at a wavelength near 13.4 nm, a Mo/Si multilayer mirror (comprising alternatingly stacked molybdenum (Mo) and silicon (Si) layers) exhibits a reflectivity of 67.5% of normal-incidence EUV light. Similarly, at a wavelength near 11.3 nm, a Mo/Be multilayer mirror (comprising alternatingly stacked Mo and beryllium (Be) layers) exhibits a reflectivity of 70.2% of normal-incidence EUV light. See, e.g., Montcalm, Proc. SPIE 3331:42 (1998). \n",
      "An EUV microlithography system principally comprises an EUV source, an illumination-optical system, a reticle stage, a projection-optical system, and a substrate stage. For the EUV source, a laser-plasma light source, a discharge-plasma light source, or an external source (e.g., electron-storage ring or synchrotron) can be used. The illumination-optical system normally comprises: (1) a grazing-incidence mirror that reflects EUV radiation, from the source, incident at a grazing angle of incidence on the reflective surface of the mirror, (2) multiple multilayer mirrors of which the reflective surface is a multilayer film, and (3) a filter that only admits the passage of EUV radiation of a prescribed wavelength. Thus, the reticle is illuminated with EUV radiation of a desired wavelength. \n",
      "Because no known materials can transmit EUV radiation to any useful extent, the reticle is a “reflection” reticle rather than a conventional transmissive reticle as used in optical microlithography. EUV radiation reflected from the reticle enters the projection-optical system, which focuses a reduced (demagnified) image of the illuminated portion of the reticle pattern on the substrate. The substrate (usually a semiconductor “wafer”) is coated on its upstream-facing surface with a suitable resist so as to be imprintable with the image. Because EUV radiation is attenuated by absorption by the atmosphere, the various optical systems, including the reticle and substrate, are contained in a vacuum chamber evacuated to a suitable vacuum level (e.g., 1×10−5 Torr or less). \n",
      "The projection-optical system typically comprises multiple multilayer mirrors. Because the maximal reflectivity of a multilayer mirror to EUV radiation currently achievable is not 100%, to minimize the loss of EUV radiation during propagation through the projection-optical system, the system should contain the fewest number of multilayer mirrors as possible. For example, a projection-optical system consisting of four multilayer mirrors is described in Jewell and Thompson, U.S. Pat. No. 5,315,629, and Jewell, U.S. Pat. No. 5,063,586, and a projection-optical system consisting of six multilayer mirrors is described in Williamson, Japan Kôkai Patent Publication No. Hei 9-211332 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,815,310. \n",
      "In contrast to a refractive optical system through which the light flux propagates in one direction, in a reflective optical system, the light flux typically propagates back-and-forth from mirror to mirror as the flux propagates through the system. Due to the need to avoid diminution of the light flux by the multilayer mirrors as much as possible, it is difficult to increase the numerical aperture (NA) of a reflective optical system. For example, in a conventional four-mirror optical system, the maximum obtainable NA is 0.15. In a conventional six-mirror optical system, a considerably higher NA (e.g., 0.25) can be obtained. Normally, the number of multilayer mirrors in the projection-optical system is an even number, which allows the reticle stage and substrate stage to be disposed on opposite sides of the projection-optical system. \n",
      "In view of the constraints discussed above, in an EUV projection-optical system aberrations must be corrected using a limited number of reflective surfaces. Due to the limited ability of a small number of spherical-surface mirrors in achieving adequate correction of aberrations, the multilayer mirrors in the projection-optical system normally have aspherical reflective surfaces. Also, the projection-optical system normally is configured as a “ring-field” system in which aberrations are corrected only in the vicinity of a prescribed image height. With such a system, to transfer the entire pattern on the reticle onto the substrate, exposure is conducted by moving the reticle stage and substrate stage at respective scanning velocities that differ from each other by the demagnification factor of the projection-optical system. \n",
      "The EUV projection-optical system described above is “diffraction-limited” and cannot achieve its specified performance level unless the wavefront aberration of EUV radiation propagating through the system can be made sufficiently small. An allowable value for the wavefront aberration for diffraction-limited optical systems normally is less than or equal to {fraction (1/14)} of the wavelength used, in terms of a root-mean-square (RMS) value, according to Maréchal's criterion. Born and Wolf, Principles of Optics, 7th ed., Cambridge University Press, p. 528 (1999). The Maréchal's condition is necessary to achieve a Strehl intensity of 80% or greater (the ratio between maximum point-image intensities for an optical system having aberrations versus an aberration-free optical system). For optimal performance, the projection-optical system for an actual EUV microlithography apparatus desirably exhibits aberrations sufficiently reduced so as to fit within this criterion. \n",
      "As noted above, in EUV microlithography technology that is the object of intensive research efforts, an exposure wavelength mainly in the range of 11 nm to 13 nm is used. With respect to the wavefront aberration (WFE) in an optical system, the maximal profile error (FE) that can be allowed per multilayer mirror is expressed as follows:\n",
      " FE=(WFE)/2/(n)½  (1)\n",
      "wherein n denotes the number of multilayer mirrors in the optical system. The reason for dividing by 2 is that, in a reflective optical system, both the incident light and the reflected light are subject to profile errors; hence, an error of twice the profile error is applied to the wavefront aberration. In a diffraction-limited optical system, the profile error (FE) allowable per multilayer mirror can be expressed in terms of the wavelength λ and the number (n) of multilayer mirrors:\n",
      " FE=λ/28/(n)½  (2)\n",
      "At λ=13 nm the value of FE is 0.23 nm RMS for an optical system consisting of four multilayer mirrors, and 0.19 nm RMS for an optical system consisting of six multilayer mirrors. \n",
      "Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to fabricate such high-precision aspherical multilayer mirrors, which is a major factor currently hampering efforts to commercialize EUV microlithography. To date, the maximum mechanical accuracy with which aspherical multilayer mirrors can be fabricated is 0.4 to 0.5 nm RMS. Gwyn, Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography White Paper, EUV LLC, p. 17 (1998). Thus, commercial realization of EUV microlithography still requires substantial improvements in machining technology and measurement techniques for aspherical multilayer mirrors. \n",
      "Recently, an important technique was disclosed offering prospects of correcting sub-nanometer profile errors of a multilayer mirror. Yamamoto, 7th International Conference on Synchrotron Radiation Instrumentation, Berlin, Germany, Aug. 21-25, 2000, POS 2-189. In this technique the surface of a multilayer mirror is locally “shaved” one layer-pair at a time. The basic principles of this technique are described with reference to FIGS. 29(A)-29(B). Referring first to FIG. 29(A), the removal of a pair of layers is considered. The depicted surface is a multilayer film fabricated by alternatingly stacking respective layers of two substances, denoted “A” and “B” (e.g., silicon (Si) and molybdenum (Mo)), at a fixed period length d. In FIG. 29(B), the uppermost pair of layers A, B (representing one period length d) has been removed. In FIG. 29(A) the optical path length OP, through a pair of film layers A, B having a period length d, of a normal-incidence ray is expressed by the equation:\n",
      " OP=(n A)(d A)+(n B)(d B)  (3)\n",
      "wherein dA and dB denote the respective thicknesses of the layers A,B, such that dA+dB=d. The terms nA and nB denote the respective refractive indices of the substances A and B, respectively. \n",
      "In FIG. 29(B), the optical path length of the region, having a thickness d, from which one pair of layers A, B has been removed from the topmost surface, is given by OP′=nd, wherein n denotes the refractive index of a vacuum (n=1). Thus, removing the topmost pair of layers A, B from the multilayer film changes the optical path length over which an incident light beam propagates; this is optically equivalent to correcting the reflected wavefront profile of the changed portion of the multilayer mirror. By removing the topmost pair of layers A, B, the change in optical path length (i.e., the change in surface profile) can be given by:\n",
      "Δ=OP′−OP  (4)\n",
      "As noted above, in the EUV wavelength region, the refractive index of substances is very close to unity. Thus, Δ is small, which offers the prospect of making accurate wavefront-profile corrections using this method. \n",
      "For example, consider a Mo/Si multilayer mirror irradiated at a wavelength of 13.4 nm. At direct (normal) incidence, let d=6.8 nm, dMo=2.3 nm, and dSi=4.5 nm. At λ=13.4 nm, nMo=0.92 and nSi=0.998. Calculating optical path lengths yields OP=6.6 nm, OP′=6.8 nm, and Δ=0.2 nm. By performing a conventional surface-machining step that removes the topmost pair of layers of Mo and Si (collectively having a thickness of 6.8 nm) wavefront-profile corrections of 0.2 nm can be made. In the case of a Mo/Si multilayer film, because the refractive index of the Si layer is close to unity, changes in the optical path length mainly depend upon the presence or absence of a Mo layer rather than the respective Si layer. Therefore, when removing a surficial pair of layers from a Mo/Si multilayer film, accurate control of the thickness of the Si layer is unnecessary. For example, a dSi=4.5 nm allows a layer-removal machining step to be stopped in the middle of the Si layer. Thus, by performing layer-removal machining at an accuracy of a few nanometers, it is possible to achieve a wavefront-profile correction in the order of 0.2 nm. \n",
      "The reflectivity of a multilayer mirror generally increases with the number of stacked layers, but the increase is asymptotic. I.e., upon forming a certain number of layers (e.g., about 50 layer pairs), the reflectivity of the multilayer structure becomes “saturated” at a particular constant and exhibits no further increase with additional layer pairs. Hence, with a multilayer mirror having a sufficient number of layer pairs to yield a saturated reflectivity, no significant change in reflectivity results when a few surficial layers are removed from the multilayer film. \n",
      "The Yamamoto method (by removing one or more surficial pairs of layers from selected regions of the multilayer film) yields a discontinuous correction of the wavefront profile of light reflected from the mirror. For example, consider a transverse profile of a reflective-surface of a multilayer mirror as shown in FIG. 30(A). Performing the Yamamoto method results in removing selected portions of surficial layer pairs (FIG. 30(B)). However, note the abrupt edges of affected layer pairs. \n",
      "According to Yamamoto, to remove a selected region of a surficial pair of layers, a mask technique is used, as shown in FIG. 31(A), which depicts a mirror substrate 1 on which a multilayer film 2 has been formed. A mask 3 is defined in a layer of a suitable photoresist applied directly on the surface of the multilayer film 2. To form the mask 3, the resist is exposed to define regions corresponding to selected regions of the multilayer film 2 in which a surficial pair of layers is to be removed. The unexposed resist is removed, leaving the patterned mask 3. Regions of the surface of the multilayer film 2 unprotected by the mask 3 are subjected to sputter-etching using an ion beam 4 or the like to remove the surficial pair of layers selectively. After sputter-etching, the remaining mask 3 is removed, yielding a mirror structure in which portions 5 of the surficial pair of layers are removed (FIG. 31(B)). \n",
      "For clarity, in FIGS. 29(A)-29(B), 30(A)-30(B), and 31(A)-31(B), the depicted number of layers is fewer than the number that would be used in an actual multilayer mirror. \n",
      "Corrections of a reflected wavefront performed according to Yamamoto produces on-surface discontinuous phases of reflected waves, especially at the edges of regions in which a surficial pair of layers has been removed. This results in a jagged (discontinuous) cross-sectional profile of the reflection wavefront. A discontinuous reflection wavefront can produce unexpected phenomena, such as diffraction, that degrades the performance of the optical system and seriously compromises any prospect of achieving a desired high resolution. As a result, a correction of less than 0.2 nm cannot be achieved. \n",
      "In other words, with a target profile error of 0.19-0.23 nm RMS for an EUV optical system (see Equation (2), above), the unit of machining according to Yamamoto is in the order of 0.2 nm, as noted above. Hence, because the Yamamoto technique is inadequate for achieving the target profile error of the optical system, there is a need for methods that achieve more accurate machining of the multilayer-mirror surface. \n",
      "Furthermore, when removing selected local regions of surficial layers as described above, the local regions can be shaved unequally by the ion beam. As a result, the machined surface can include portions in which substance A is exposed and other portions in which substance B is exposed, wherein the thickness of these exposed regions is not uniform. In these situations, the reflectivity of EUV radiation from the mirror surface exhibits a distribution and this is not constant over the surface of the multilayer mirror. Generally, a substance such as Mo is the topmost layer. If the thickness of the exposed Mo layer is approximately equal to the thickness of each of the other Mo layers in the periodic multilayer structure, then an increase in the thickness of Mo increases the reflectivity. On the other hand, if Si is the topmost layer, then the reflectivity decreases with an increase in the number of Si layers. Furthermore, in regions in which Mo is exposed, the exposed Mo tends to oxidize, which reduces the EUV reflectivity of the regions. \n",
      "Hence, whenever local machining is conducted on a Mo/Si multilayer film (normally having a pre-machining uniform in-surface reflectivity distribution), such that the multilayer film surface is machined unevenly, an uneven in-surface reflectivity of the multilayer film surface results. If the multilayer mirror is used in a reduction projection-exposure system using EUV radiation, if an in-surface reflectivity distribution is created on a multilayer mirror used in such an optical system, then illumination irregularities in the exposure field and non-uniform values of Δ can result, which reduces exposure performance. Therefore, there is a need for methods for reducing the in-surface reflectivity distribution for a multilayer film on which localized machining has been conducted. \n",
      "In addition, accurate surficial machining requires that required corrections be determined accurately in advance of machining. Fizeau interferometers using visible light (e.g., He-Ne laser light) have been used widely for performing measurements of surface profiles. The accuracy of such measurements, however, usually is inadequate for meeting modern accuracy requirements. Also, a conventional visible-light interferometer cannot be used for measuring a surface “corrected” by localized removal of material from the multilayer-film surface. This is because the profile of a reflected visible light wavefront is different from the profile of a reflected wavefront at an EUV wavelength. \n",
      "In view of the shortcomings of conventional methods and multilayer mirrors produced thereby, the present invention in its various aspects provides multilayer mirrors that can produce a reflected wavefront having reduced aberrations than conventional multilayer mirrors, without reducing reflectivity of the mirror to EUV radiation. \n",
      "According to a first aspect of the invention, methods are provided for making a multilayer mirror. In an embodiment of the methods, a stack of alternatingly superposed layers of first and second materials is formed on a surface of a mirror substrate. The first and second materials have different respective refractive indices with respect to EUV radiation. Wavefront aberrations of EUV radiation reflected from a surface of the multilayer mirror are reduced by a method including measuring (at an EUV wavelength at which the multilayer mirror is to be used) a profile of a reflected wavefront from the surface to obtain a map of the surface. The map indicates regions targeted for surficial removal of one or more layers of the multilayer film necessary to reduce wavefront aberrations of EUV light reflected from the surface. Based on the map, at least one surficial layer in each of the indicated regions is removed. \n",
      "In this embodiment, the measurement step is performed “at wavelength” (i.e., at the EUV wavelength at which the mirror will be used). Desirable measurement techniques utilize a diffractive optical element, and can be any of the following: shearing interferometry, point-diffraction interferometry, the Foucalt test, the Ronchi test, and the Hartmann Test. The measurements can be performed of EUV light reflected from an individual multilayer mirror, or can be performed of EUV light transmitted through an EUV optical system including at least one subject multilayer mirror. \n",
      "In an example of the latter method, the multilayer mirror is assembled into an EUV optical system that is transmissive to EUV radiation at a wavelength at which the multilayer mirror is to be used. At that EUV wavelength the profile of a wavefront transmitted through the EUV optical system is measured to obtain a map of the surface indicating regions targeted for surficial removal of one or more layers of the multilayer film necessary to reduce wavefront aberrations of EUV light reflected from the surface. Based on the map, one or more surficial layers are removed in the indicated regions. \n",
      "During the layer-forming step, the stack can be formed with multiple layer pairs each including a first layer (comprising, e.g., Mo) and a second layer (comprising, e.g., Si). To provide the mirror with good reflectivity to EUV radiation, each layer pair typically has a period in a range of 6 to 12 nm. \n",
      "After forming the multilayer mirror, the mirror can be incorporated into an EUV optical system, which in turn can be incorporated into an EUV microlithography system. \n",
      "According to another aspect of the invention, multilayer mirrors are provided that are reflective to incident EUV radiation. An embodiment of such a mirror comprises a mirror substrate and a thin-film layer stack formed on a surface of the mirror substrate. The stack includes multiple thin-film first layer groups and multiple thin-film second layer groups alternatingly superposed relative to each other in a periodically repeating manner. Each first layer group includes at least one sublayer of a first material having a refractive index to EUV light substantially equal to the refractive index of a vacuum, and each second layer group includes at least one sublayer of a second material and at least one sublayer of a third material. The first and second layer groups in this embodiment are alternatingly superposed relative to each other in a periodically repeating configuration. The second and third materials have respective refractive indices that are substantially similar to each other but that are different from the refractive index of the first material sufficiently such that the stack is reflective to incident EUV light. The second and third materials have differential reactivities to sublayer-removal conditions such that a first sublayer-removal condition will preferentially remove a sublayer of the second material without substantial removal of an underlying sublayer of the third material. Similarly, a second sublayer-removal condition will preferentially remove a sublayer of the third material without substantial removal of an underlying sublayer of the second material. Typically, the second material can be Mo, the third material can be Ru, and the first material can be Si. \n",
      "Each second layer group can comprise multiple sublayer sets each comprising a sublayer of the second material and a sublayer of the third material. The sublayers in this configuration are alternatingly stacked to form the second layer group. \n",
      "In another embodiment of methods according to the invention, on a surface of a mirror substrate, a thin-film layer stack (including multiple thin-film first layer groups and multiple thin-film second layer groups alternatingly superposed relative to each other) are formed in a periodically repeating configuration.

In selected regions of a surficial second layer group, one or more sublayers of the surficial second layer group are selectively removed so as to reduce wavefront aberrations of EUV radiation reflected from the surface. Removing one or more sublayers of the surficial second layer group can yield a phase difference in EUV components reflected from the indicated regions, compared to EUV light reflected from other regions in which no sublayers are removed or a different number of sublayers are removed. Removing one or more sublayers of the surficial second group layer can comprise selectively exposing the indicated regions to one or both the first and second sublayer-removal conditions as required to achieve an indicated change in a reflected wavefront profile from the surface. \n",
      "This method embodiment can further include the step of measuring a profile of a reflected wavefront from the surface to obtain a map of the surface indicated the regions targeted for removal of the one or more sublayers of the surficial second layer group. \n",
      "One or more multilayer mirrors produced according to this method embodiment can be assembled into an EUV optical system, which in turn can be assembled into an EUV microlithography system. \n",

The first material desirably is Si, and the second material desirably is Mo and/or Ru. The respective period lengths are within a range of 6 to 12 nm. \n",
      "In this embodiment, if Γ1 denotes the ratio of the respective second-layer thickness to the period length of the first group, and Γ2 denotes the ratio of the respective second-layer thickness to the period length of the second group, then desirably Γ2<Γ1. Γ2 can be established such that, whenever a reflection-wavefront correction is made to the mirror by removing one or more surficial layers of the mirror, the magnitude of the correction per unit thickness of the second material is as prescribed. \n",

      "Measurement of Transmitted Wavefront Profile \n",
      "In some cases, if a lack of accuracy is experienced in the interference-measurement techniques such as those described above, at-wavelength measurements of the reflected wavefront from a multilayer mirror can be difficult to perform. In such an instance, a mockup of an EUV optical system can be configured using suitable optical elements and the multilayer mirror to be evaluated, and at-wavelength measurements of a wavefront transmitted by the optical system. At-wavelength measurements of a wavefront transmitted by an optical system are easier to perform than measuring the surface of a multilayer mirror. The reasons for this are as follows: Most surfaces in EUV optical systems are aspherical. Aspherical surfaces are more difficult to measure than spherical surfaces. However, even though one or more surfaces of the subject optical system are aspherical, a wavefront transmitted by the optical system will be spherical and therefore easier to measure. According to Equation (1), above, the tolerance for a wavefront aberration (WFE) of an optical system is larger than the tolerance for profile error (FE) of the multilayer mirror. Thus, it is easier to measure the wavefront than to measure the mirror surface. Optical-design software can be used to compute respective corrections to be applied to the reflective surface of the mirror from the results of the transmitted wavefront-profile measurements. Subsequent procedures are similar to corresponding procedures for measuring the profile of the reflective surface of a separate multilayer mirror. Exemplary techniques for measuring a transmitted wavefront profile are summarized below: \n",

Alternatively, the ions 4 can be of any of various reactive ionic species, such as fluorine ions or chlorine ions. Depending upon the properties of the ion source employed, the ion beam usually is not collimated, but rather exhibits a scattering angle relative to the axis of ion-beam propagation. The resulting spatial distribution of the ion beam directed onto the surface of the multilayer film 2 yields a machined region 52 (FIG. 17(B)) typically wider than the corresponding aperture 3 a and exhibiting tapered shoulders and a smooth elevational profile. The shoulder profile and width of the machined area 52 can be adjusted by changing the distance h; the greater the distance h of the mask 3 from the surface of the multilayer film 2, the broader the machined region 52 relative to the respective opening 3 a.  \n",
      "FIGS. 18(A)-18(B) depict chemical-vapor machining (CVM), during which the workpiece (mirror) 54 is electrically grounded as shown. Machining is performed by positioning an electrode 55 adjacent a desired region on the surface of the multilayer film 2 while applying a radio-frequency (RF) voltage 58 (at a frequency of approximately 100 MHz) to the electrode 55. Meanwhile, a reactive-gas mixture (of, e.g., helium (He) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6)) is discharged at the surface of the multilayer film 2 from a nozzle 56. Under such conditions between the electrode 55 and the surface of the multilayer film 2, a plasma 57 is generated. In this example, the plasma 57 includes fluorine ions that react with the surface of the multilayer film 2 and produce reaction products having a high vapor pressure. Thus, the surface of the multilayer film 2 adjacent the tip of the electrode 56 is eroded. Processing speed is a function of the density of the plasma 57, and hence is greatest directly beneath the electrode 55 and slower around the periphery of the electrode 55. The resulting differential machining rate yields a smooth elevational profile as indicated in FIG. 18(B). \n",
      "Although the description above is set forth in the context of a Mo/Si multilayer film on a reflective multilayer mirror intended for use with a 13.4 nm wavelength characteristic of EUV microlithography, it will be understood that this is not intended to be limiting. The same principles discussed above can be applied with equal facility to multilayer films suitable for use with other wavelengths, and made of other film materials besides Mo and Si. \n",
      "In any event, by reducing the incidence of discontinuous topology when performing surficial machining of one or more layers from the surface of a multilayer film, the optical properties of the multilayer mirror are not as prone to degradation (especially by diffraction) when correcting the wavefront profile of EUV light reflected from the surface of the mirror. \n",
      "Selective Reactive-Ion Etching \n",
      "Reactive-ion etching (RIE) also can be used to achieve a smooth corrected-wavefront profile from a multilayer mirror. In using this technique, different etching rates of different thin-film materials can be exploited in a useful way. \n",
      "By way of example, consider a multilayer film comprising multiple layer pairs (each 6.8 nm thick) of Mo (each 2.4 nm thick) and Si (each 4.4 nm thick). A corrected surface profile of approximately 0.2 nm can be achieved by removing a surficial layer pair from the multilayer film using RIE. The resulting correction is due principally to removal of the Mo layer. However, it is difficult to stop removal of a Mo layer at a desired thickness of the Mo layer. \n",
      "To provide better control of removing a desired thickness of the Mo layer, the Mo layer is configured as a layer group comprising respective sub-layers of multiple substances, wherein the layer group has a total thickness of 2.4 nm. The different substances exhibit different respective rates of erosion by RIE. By configuring each Mo layer as a respective layer group, it is possible to control the depth of etching of the layer group by RIE by exploiting the differences in the RIE properties of the sublayers. \n",
      "For example, with respect to EUV radiation, Ru (ruthenium) has an index of refraction that is sufficiently close to that of Mo to allow Ru to be used as a sublayer material along with at least one sublayer of Mo. In other words, at least one surficial Mo layer in the multilayer mirror is substituted with a respective Mo “layer group” having the same total thickness (e.g., 2.4 nm) as the original Mo layer. The layer group consists of at least one sublayer of Mo and at least one sublayer of Ru. The sublayers are formed in an alternating manner with respect to the materials. Since Ru has an index of refraction close to that of Mo in the EUV region, each layer group optically behaves as a respective layer consisting only of Mo, and thus has little effect on the reflective properties of the mirror. \n",
      "When performing RIE of a layer group as described above, the RIE parameters can be configured to remove Mo preferentially to Ru, or configured to remove Ru preferentially to Mo. For example, a “Mo-sublayer-removal RIE” involving reactive chemical species that react preferentially with Mo compared to Ru can be used to remove a topmost Mo sublayer. Removal of the topmost Mo sublayer exposes the underlying Ru sublayer, which is relatively resistant to the prevailing RIE conditions. Consequently, RIE-mediated removal of material from the surface of the mirror stops at the Ru sublayer. Conversely, a “Ru-sublayer-removal RIE” involving reactive chemical species that react preferentially with Ru but compared to with Mo can be used to remove a topmost Ru layer. Removal of the topmost Ru sublayer exposes the underlying Mo sublayer, which is relatively resistant to the prevailing RIE conditions. Consequently, RIE-mediated removal of material from the surface of the mirror stops at the Mo sublayer. \n",
      "The selective RIE technique described above allows Mo and Ru layers to be removed selectively from a topmost layer group, one sublayer at a time. The technique is not limited, however, to layer groups each comprising only two sublayers. Each layer group alternatively can comprise multiple sublayer pairs each including a sublayer of Mo and a sublayer of Ru. For example, a layer group can comprise three layer pairs of Mo and Ru sublayers that are alternatingly stacked in the layer group to yield a total thickness of, for example, 2.4 nm for the layer group. In this example, the thickness of each individual Mo and Ru sublayer is 0.4 nm. \n",
      "Continuing further with this example, if the topmost sublayer in the topmost layer group is Mo, execution of Mo-sublayer-removal RIE followed by Ru-sublayer-removal RIE can be performed to individually remove the topmost Mo sublayer followed by the topmost Ru sublayer of the layer group. Thus, a total of 0.8 nm of surficial material is removed from the layer group, leaving two pairs of Mo and Ru sublayers remaining in the layer group. By removing 0.8 nm of surficial material, a correction of 0.067 nm is made to the surface profile. If only one sublayer had been removed, a 0.033 nm correction would have been made. \n",
      "Generally, if a Mo layer group is constructed by alternatingly stacking Mo and Ru sublayers for a total of z sublayers (in place of the original Mo layer), the resulting layer group would have z/2 sublayer pairs, and the thickness of each sublayer would be (2.4 nm)/z. This would provide a correction per sublayer of (0.2 nm)/z in the surface profile. By way of another example, if z=4 (two sublayer pairs), then the amount of correction would be 0.05 nm per sublayer. By way of yet another example, if z=10 (five sublayer pairs), then the amount of correction would be 0.02 nm per sublayer. \n",
      "RIE is performed using halide gases, such as chlorides and fluorides, or chlorine and oxygen gases. The gases are ionized and directed onto the target surface to cause etching of the target surface. Selected combinations of target materials can be etched depending upon the particular etching gas(es) used and the material properties of the target surface to be etched. Selective etching can be conducted by using appropriate reactive gases that react rapidly with specific target materials versus reactive gases that react only slowly or not at all with the specific target materials, thereby allowing complex and detailed surficial profiles to be created. To terminate and control the etching process, a layer that is not etched by a given gas is provided as a protection sublayer so that the etching does not proceed depthwise past the protection sublayer. \n",
      "In the example described above involving a layer group comprising alternating sublayers of Mo and Ru, RIE parameters can be selected that favor etching of the Mo sublayer (wherein the underlying Ru sublayer acts as a protection layer) or that favor etching of the Ru sublayer (wherein the underlying Mo sublayer acts as a protection layer). Thus, the Mo and Ru sublayers in the layer group can be removed one sublayer at a time. \n",
      "Thus, in a Mo/Si layer pair in a multilayer film of a multilayer mirror, a Mo layer is replaced with a layer group consisting of at least one Mo sublayer and at least one Ru layer. By combining RIE protocols that achieve selective removal of either a topmost Mo sublayer or a topmost Ru sublayer of the topmost layer group, a smaller depthwise increment of material can be removed from the multilayer film during surficial machining, compared to the conventional 0.2-nm or greater increment that is removed using conventional methods. \n",
      "Optimizing Reflectivity \n",
      "As noted above, the change Δ in optical path length due to removing a layer from a multilayer film (comprised of alternating layers of substance A and substance B) can be found from the equation:\n",
      "Δ=nd−(n A d A +n B d B)\n",
      "wherein n denotes the refractive index of a vacuum, nA denotes the refractive index of substance A, nB denotes the refractive index of substance B, d is the period length of the multilayer film, dA denotes the thickness of a layer of substance A, and dB denotes the thickness of a layer of substance B. \n",
      "To obtain high reflectivity, multilayer films generally are composed of multiple layers of a substance (e.g., Mo, Ru, or Be) having a refractive index that differs substantially from the refractive index of a vacuum and of a substance (e.g., Si) having a refractive index that differs very little from the refractive index of a vacuum. In this discussion, substance “A” is designated as having a refractive index that differs substantially from that of a vacuum, and substance “B” is designated as having a refractive index that differs very little from the refractive index of a vacuum. Let Γ denote the ratio of the thickness of a layer of substance A to the period length (d) of the multilayer film. During local machining of a multifilm mirror performed to achieve a corrected wavefront of EUV light from the mirror, a change in optical path length of the multilayer film occurs principally whenever a layer of substance A is removed. Removing a layer of substance B produces little change in optical path length. Therefore, the change, Δ, in optical path length due to the removal of one layer from the multilayer film can be minimized by reducing the value of Γ while holding d constant. \n",
      "However, changing Γ changes the reflectivity of the multilayer film to EUV light. Nevertheless, there is a value of Γ (denoted Γm) corresponding to maximum reflectivity. Reducing Γ from Γm is accompanied by a rapid reduction in reflectivity. This relationship is depicted in FIG. 21, in which the plotted data were obtained from calculations of reflectivity (R; in %) of a Mo/Si multilayer film (d=6.8 nm; number of stacked layers=50 layer pairs) to 13.4-nm EUV light directly incident on the film incidence. The abscissa is of values of Γ, the left-hand ordinate is of reflectivity, and the right-hand ordinate is of values of Δ. The linear plot is of data in the right-hand ordinate, and the curved plot is of data in the left-hand ordinate. From FIG. 21 it can be seen that reducing Γ to minimize Δ per layer pair removed from the multilayer film produces a rapid decrease in reflectivity. \n",
      "By way of example, and referring to FIG. 22, a first multilayer film 61 (comprising alternating layers of substances A and B) was deposited of which the value of Γ (i.e., Γ1) corresponded to maximal reflectivity. A second multilayer film 62 (comprising alternating layers of substances A and B) was subsequently deposited superposedly on the first multilayer film 61. The second multilayer film 62 had a value of Γ (i.e, Γ2), wherein Γ2<Γ1, configured so as to achieve a desired change in Δ. In this example, Γ1=⅓, d=6.8 nm, and the number of stacked layer pairs (N) is N1=40. FIG. 23 is a plot of the results of calculating reflectivity R of the Mo/Si multilayer film to 13.4-nm EUV light directly incident to the multilayer film. In FIG. 23 the abscissa is of values of Γ2, ranging from Γ2=0 to 0.5; the; the left-hand ordinate is of reflectivity (R, in %); and the right-hand ordinate is of the change Δ in optical path length. By comparing FIG. 23 with FIG. 21, it can be seen that a reduction in Γ over a fairly broad range results in relatively small decreases in reflectivity. Thus, the change Δ in optical path length accompanying removal of each layer from the multilayer film can be minimized without significantly sacrificing the reflectivity R of the multilayer film. \n",
      "The first multilayer film 61 desirably is optimized to obtain the maximum reflectivity R. The second multilayer film 62, formed superposedly on the first multilayer film 61, desirably is configured so as to obtain the desired change Δ in optical path length. As surficial portions of the second multilayer film 62 are removed one layer at a time, the overall reflectivity of the mirror increases, as illustrated in FIG. 24. The data plotted in FIG. 24 were obtained by calculating the reflectivity R of a Mo/Si multilayer film to which 13.4-nm EUV light was directly incident. The multilayer comprised a second multilayer film 62, in which d=6.8 nm, Γ2≠Γ1, and N2=10, stacked on a first multilayer film 61, in which d=6.8 nm, Γ1=⅓, and N1=40. The plots correspond to different respective changes Δ in optical path length of 0.2 nm, Δ=0.1 nm, Δ=0.05 nm, and Δ=0.02 nm, according to differences in Γ. As layers are removed layer-by-layer from the second multilayer film (i.e., N2 incrementally decreases from 10), the overall reflectivity of the mirror increases. For example, upon forming the second multilayer film 62 with Δ=0.05 nm and N2=10, the reflectivity R before removing any layer is 65.2%. Removing five layer pairs causes R to increase to 68.2%, and removing ten layer pairs causes R to increase to 72.5%. Thus, the smaller the change Δ in optical path length upon removing each layer pair from the surface of the multilayer film and the greater the number of layers removed, the greater the change in reflectivity. \n",
      "These changes in reflectivity of the multilayer mirror can create on-surface reflectivity irregularities after correcting the reflection wavefront profile. However, from the allowable on-surface reflectivity irregularities, optimal changes Δ in optical path length and the number of layers to be removed can be determined. \n",
      "In situations in which the tolerance for on-surface reflectivity irregularities is stringent, a substance having a refractive index that differs only a small amount from the refractive index of a vacuum can be formed on the surface of the mirror after corrective machining has been performed (see below) to provide a correction ensuring uniform reflectivity. For example, at λ=13.4 nm, the refractive index of silicon is 0.998, which is virtually equal to 1. Hence, forming a surficial silicon layer causes little change in optical path length of the multilayer film of the mirror. \n",
      "The absorption coefficient (“a”) of silicon is a=1.4×10−3 ((nm)−1). Upon propagating a distance x, the intensity of light diminishes by exp(-ax). For example, by forming a surficial layer of silicon that is 37 nm thick, reflectivity could be reduced by 10%. However, the resulting change Δ in optical path length resulting from forming the surficial silicon layer is 0.07 nm, which is acceptably small. \n",
      "Although this embodiment was described in the context of a Mo/Si multilayer film as used with a 13.4 nm EUV wavelength, it will be understood that this is not intended to be limiting. Alternatively to the configuration discussed above other wavelength regions and other multilayer-film materials can be used. In addition, it is not necessary that the materials A, B making up the first multilayer film 61 and the second multilayer film 62 be the same. \n",
      "Protective Layer to Reduce Reflectivity Variations \n",
      "[0148]FIG. 25(A) depicts a transverse elevational section of a multilayer film 65 as formed on an EUV-reflective mirror, according to this embodiment. By way of example, the depicted multilayer film 65 is of stacked alternating layers of Mo and Si (e.g., N=80 layer pairs) with a period length of d=7 nm and ratio (Γ) of Mo-layer thickness to d of Γ=0.35. The stacked layers are formed on a mirror substrate (not shown, but see FIGS. 15(A)-15(B)). After forming the multilayer film 65, a region of the surface of the film is machined away, using any of the techniques described above (e.g., ion-beam machining), to achieve correction of the reflected EUV wavefront from the surface. The resulting profile is as shown in FIG. 25(B). \n",
      "After machining, the exposed surface of the multilayer film 65 is “coated” with a cover layer 66 of Si formed at a thickness of 2 nm, as shown in FIG. 26. In the mirror of FIG. 26, the period length (d) in a machined region on the surface of the multilayer film 65 varies with position on the machined surface. \n",
      "As discussed above, the reflectivity of EUV radiation from a Si/Mo multilayer mirror is at a saturated maximum at about N=50 layer pairs. However, because surficial machining potentially can remove more than ten surface layers, a larger number such as 80 layers desirably are formed. Also, because the amount of surficial material removed by the machining step exhibits a continual change with position on the surface, the machined surface (whether of Mo or Si) has any of various profiles to which incident rays have a corresponding angle of incidence. \n",
      "The surficial Si cover layer 66 achieves a uniform reflectivity of the multilayer film 65 after machining. To illustrate this effect, reference is made to FIG. 27, which shows, by way of example, reflectivity (∘) from a surface including a 2-nm thick Si cover layer and reflectivity () from a surface lacking the Si cover layer. The subject mirror has a multilayer film comprising alternating layers of Mo and Si, and the incident EUV radiation (non-polarized) has λ=13.5 nm and an angle of incidence of 88 degrees. The abscissa lists representative conditions of the topmost layer of the multilayer film on which machining was performed. \n",
      "In regions in which Mo is exposed by machining, the reflectivity gradually increases with increases in the thickness of the topmost Mo layer. In this particular multilayer film, the maximal Mo-layer thickness is 2.45 nm. Hence, the maximal thickness of the topmost Mo layer is 2.45 nm. In regions in which Si is exposed by machining, the reflectivity decreases somewhat with increases in the thickness of the Si layer. At 4.55 nm, the maximal Si-layer thickness in the multilayer film, the reflectivity is equal to the original reflectivity. \n",
      "In this example, the magnitude of in-surface reflectivity change is approximately 1.5%. In contrast, if a 2-nm Si cover layer 66 is formed on the surface after machining, whereas the reflectivity decreases substantially at locations where Mo was exposed at the topmost layer, the reflectivity does not decline substantially in regions where Si was exposed by machining. Hence, the magnitude of the in-surface change in reflectivity is reduced to 0.7%, which is half the change experienced with no Si cover layer 66. \n",
      "In addition to the reduced change in reflectivity, the Si cover layer (especially over exposed Mo) prevents oxidation of the exposed Mo. Thus, this embodiment (which includes the Si cover layer) provides a high-precision reflection wavefront while reducing variations in reflectivity over the surface of the mirror. \n",
      "The material used to form the cover layer is not limited to Si. Alternatively, the cover layer can be of various substances capable of reducing variations in reflectivity of the mirror. Hence, as a result of the presence of the cover layer, the absolute value of the reflectivity of the mirror is not reduced. \n",
      "Although this embodiment is described using an example in which the multilayer mirror comprises alternating layers of Mo and Si, this is not intended to be limiting. Any of various other materials could be used, taking into account the wavelength of the intended reflected radiation from the mirror, the required thermal stability of the mirror, and other properties or prevailing conditions. In addition, individual layers are not limited to single elements; rather, any layer can be a compound of multiple elements or a mixture of multiple elements or compounds. \n",
      "Although this embodiment is described in the context of a multilayer film containing 80 stacked layer pairs, this is not intended to be limiting. A multilayer film mirror can have any of various numbers of layer pairs, depending upon the specifications the mirror is intended to meet, the prevailing conditions, characteristics of the radiation to be reflected from the mirror, and other factors. \n",
      "Although this embodiment is described in the context of Γ=0.35 (wherein Γ is the ratio of the thickness of the Mo layer to d, the period length of the multilayer film), this is not intended to be limiting. This ratio can be any of various other values and need not be constant throughout the full thickness of the multilayer film or over the entire surface area of the multilayer film. \n",

Upstream of the illumination-optical system IOS is an EUV source S that, in the depicted embodiment, is a laser-plasma source including a laser 91, a source 92 of plasma-forming material, and a condenser mirror 93.

The topmost layer is a Si layer 72, and the individual layers 72, 73 were stacked in an alternating manner.

Similarly, the sublayers 83 a, 83 b removed from the region 86 had a total thickness of 0.8 nm (not including the Si layer 82), which provided (when the sublayers 83 a, 83 b were removed) a correction of 0.067 nm of surface profile.
