USRE36799E - Projection optical apparatus using plural wavelengths of light 
A projection optical apparatus comprising a projection optical system for projectively focusing a pattern image of a mask under illumination by light of first wavelength onto a sensitive substrate, a stage holding the sensitive substrate, a fiducial plate disposed on the stage, a first mark detector for illuminating light of second wavelength different from the first wavelength, through a first mark area formed on the mask and the projection optical system, onto .[.the sensitive substrate or.]. a second mark area formed on the fiducial plate, then detecting optical information produced from the second mark area, a fourth mark area formed on .[.the sensitive substrate or.]. the fiducial plate and arranged in a predetermined positional relationship relative to the second mark area, a third mark area formed on the mask and arranged in a predetermined positional relationship relative to the first mark area, a second mark detector for illuminating the light of first wavelength onto the fourth mark area through the third mark area and the projection optical system, and then detecting optical information produced from the fourth mark area, under a condition that the first mark detector is detecting the optical information produced from the second mark area, and an error detector for detecting detection errors due to a distortion at respective positions in the view field of the projection optical system where the first mark area and the second mark area are present, based on the detected results by the first mark detector and the second mark detector.
