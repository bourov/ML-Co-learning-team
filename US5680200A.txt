US5680200A - Inspection apparatus and method for optical system, exposure apparatus provided with the inspection apparatus, and alignment apparatus and optical system thereof applicable to the exposure apparatus 
The present invention relates to inspection apparatus and method in which, based on images under a plurality of focus conditions formed by way of an optical system to be inspected, namely, using images under a plurality of defocal conditions, tendency in positional change or change of asymmetry between the images is calculated so as to specify at least one of aberration condition and optical adjustment condition of the optical system to be inspected as well as to exposure apparatuses and overlay accuracy measurement apparatuses provided with the inspection apparatus. In addition, the present invention relates to an image-forming optical system suitable to an alignment apparatus which is applicable to the exposure apparatuses. This image-forming optical system comprises a correction optical system for intentionally generating asymmetric aberration or symmetric aberration in the image-forming optical system and a decentering mechanism for decentering the correction optical system to cancel asymmetric aberration or symmetric aberration in the image-forming optical system.
