US7924436B2 - Method for approximating an influence of an optical system on the state of polarization of optical radiation 
A method for approximating an influence of an optical system on the state of polarization of optical radiation comprises the steps of providing incoming optical radiation for the optical system in several incoming states of polarization, including at least one incoming state having circularly polarized radiation components; directing the incoming optical radiation onto the optical system; measuring at least one characteristic, including a phase distribution, of a resulting outgoing optical radiation emerging from the optical system with respect to each of the incoming states of polarization; and approximating the influence of the optical system on the state of polarization of optical radiation by evaluating the measured characteristics of the outgoing optical radiation.
