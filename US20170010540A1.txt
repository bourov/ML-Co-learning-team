US20170010540A1 - Method and apparatus for generating a predetermined three-dimensional contour of an optical component and/or a wafe
A method for generating a predetermined three-dimensional contour of a component and/or a wafer comprises: (a) determining a deviation of an existing three-dimensional contour of the component and/or the wafer from the predetermined three-dimensional contour; (b) calculating at least one three-dimensional arrangement of laser pulses having one or more parameter sets defining the laser pulses for correcting the determined existing deviation of the three-dimensional contour from the predetermined three-dimensional contour; and (c) applying the calculated at least one three-dimensional arrangement of laser pulses on the component and/or the wafer for generating the predetermined three-dimensional contour.
