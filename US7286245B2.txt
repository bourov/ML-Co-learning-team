US7286245B2 - Method and apparatus for determining the influencing of the state of polarization by an optical system; and an analyser 
A method and an apparatus for determining the influencing of the state of polarization of optical radiation by an optical system under test, wherein radiation with a defined entrance state of polarization is directed onto the optical system, the exit-side state of polarization is measured, and the influencing of the state of polarization is determined by the optical system with the aid of evaluation of the exit state of polarization with reference to the entrance state of polarization. An analyser arrangement which can be used for this purpose is also disclosed. The method and the apparatus are used, e.g., to determine the influencing of the state of polarization of optical radiation by an optical imaging system of prescribable aperture, the determination being performed in a pupil-resolved fashion.
