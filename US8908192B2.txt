US8908192B2 - Method and apparatus for qualifying optics of a projection exposure tool for microlithography 
A method for qualifying optics (16; 14, 16) of a projection exposure tool (10) for microlithography. The optics include (16; 14, 16) at least one mirror element (14-1 to 14-7, 16-1 to 16-6) with a reflective coating (52) disposed on the latter. The method includes: irradiating electromagnetic radiation (13, 42) of at least two different wavelengths onto the optics (16; 14, 16), a penetration depth of the radiation into the coating (52) of the mirror element varying between the individual wavelengths, taking an optical measurement on the optics (16; 14, 16) for each of the wavelengths, and evaluating the measurement results for the different wavelengths taking into consideration a respective penetration depth of the radiation into the coating (52) of the mirror element for each of the different wavelengths.
