US20100014065A1 - Method for improving imaging properties of an optical system, and such an optical system 
The disclosure relates to a method for improving optical properties of an optical system. The optical system has a plurality of optical elements for imaging a pattern onto a substrate that is arranged in an image plane of the optical system. The method includes detecting at least one time-dependent, at least partially reversible aberration of the optical system that is caused by heating of at least one of the optical elements. The method also includes at least partially correcting the aberration by replacing at least one optical element from the plurality of optical elements with at least one optical compensation element. The disclosure also relates to such an optical system with improved imaging properties.
