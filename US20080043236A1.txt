US20080043236A1 - Optical Property Measurement Apparatus and Optical Property Measurement Method, Exposure Apparatus and Exposure Method, and Device Manufacturing Method 
An optical property measurement apparatus is equipped with an optical system unit that selectively places an opening section for passing illumination light, a microlens array for measuring wavefront aberration, and a polarization detection system for measuring a polarization state of the illumination light on an optical path of the illumination light. Accordingly an illumination shape and a size of an illumination optical system, wavefront aberration of a projection optical system and a polarization state of the illumination light can be measured together. Therefore, for example, even when exposure is performed with polarized illumination that is a type of modified illumination, highly-accurate exposure can be achieved by adjusting various optical systems based on the measurement results.
