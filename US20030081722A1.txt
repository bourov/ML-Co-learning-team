US20030081722A1 - Multilayer-film mirrors for use in extreme UV optical systems, and methods for manufacturing such mirrors exhibiting improved wave aberrations 
Methods are disclosed for correcting the wave aberrations of light reflected from multilayer-film mirrors as used in, e.g., optical systems as used for EUV lithography (EUVL) apparatus. Wave aberrations are corrected by addition and/or removal of one or more layers (typically layer-sets) to and from, respectively, the surface of the multilayer film of the mirror. In certain embodiments, layer-removal is monitored in situ by any of several techniques. In other embodiments, mirror substrates are processed to a prescribed shape precision and surface roughness, followed by formation of the multilayer film and assembly of the mirrors into the intended optical assembly. The wave aberration is measured at operating wavelength. If the measured wave aberration is not within specifications, then the mirrors are corrected individually by selective removal and/or addition of layer-set(s). The corrected mirrors are reassembled and re-tested as an optical assembly. This cycle is repeated as required. In other embodiments, the mirrors are corrected by removing layer-sets in layer-set increments, followed by re-formation, at less than normal layer thickness, of the layer of the material having the most impact on defining the reflection wave-front, until the desired layer thickness is achieved. In yet other embodiments, layer(s) are removed such that the resulting corrected reflection wave-front is smooth.
