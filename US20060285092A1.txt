US20060285092A1 - Exposure apparatus and device fabrication method 
An exposure apparatus for forming a predetermined pattern on a substrate by using exposure light, includes a stage apparatus which is movable with respect to an optical axis of the exposure light; a light-transmissive member provided at the stage apparatus, wherein a liquid is supplied on an upper surface of the light-transmissive member; and a measurement device which is settable below the light-transmissive member when measurement using the measurement device is performed. Leakage or entrance of a liquid used for exposure into an optical measurement device such as a wavefront aberration measurement device can be prevented, thereby enabling preferable optical adjustment such as imaging performance or optical characteristics.
