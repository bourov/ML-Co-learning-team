US6665049B1 - Photomask, method for manufacturing the same, projection aligner using the photomask, and projection exposing method 
The present invention is to provide a photomask which has a sufficient durability to short-wavelength exposure beams, too, and also can prevent any foreign matter from adhering to patterns for transfer. In a photomask on which a transfer pattern to be transferred to an exposure-target substrate 19 is formed and through which a stated exposure beam applied to a pattern surface 1P where the transfer pattern is formed is guided to a projection optical system PL for forming an image of the pattern, the photomask comprises a transmitting plate 3 disposed apart from the pattern surface by a stated interval d0 and having a stated thickness h and a transmission to the exposure beam, and the transmitting plate is substantially square and fulfills a stated condition.
