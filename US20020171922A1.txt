US20020171922A1 - Multilayer reflective mirrors for EUV, wavefront-aberration-correction methods for same, and EUV optical systems comprising same 
Multilayer mirrors are disclosed for use especially in “Extreme Ultraviolet” (“soft X-ray,” or “EUV”) optical systems. Each multilayer mirror includes a stack of alternating layers of a first material and a second material, respectively, to form an EUV-reflective surface. The first material has a refractive index substantially the same as a vacuum, and the second material has a refractive index that differs sufficiently from the refractive index of the first material to render the mirror reflective to EUV radiation. The wavefront profile of EUV light reflected from the surface is corrected by removing (“machining” away) at least one surficial layer of the stack in selected region(s) of the surface of the stack. Machining can be performed such that machined regions have smooth tapered edges rather than abrupt edges. The stack can include first and second layer groups that allow the unit of machining to be very small, thereby improving the accuracy with which wavefront-aberration correction can be conducted. Also disclosed are various at-wavelength techniques for measuring reflected-wavelength profiles of the mirror. The mirror surface can include a cover layer of a durable material having high transparency and that reduces variations in reflectivity of the surface caused by machining the selected regions.
