US20110205514A1 - Measuring method and measuring apparatus of pupil transmittance distribution, exposure method and exposure apparatus, and device manufacturing method 
A measuring apparatus for measuring a pupil transmittance distribution of an optical system to be examined has a diffraction grating mounted on a first surface in an optical Fourier transform relation with a pupil of the optical system, an illumination optical system which makes a beam inclined relative to the optical axis, incident to a predetermined position on the first surface so that a +first-order diffracted beam, generated through the diffraction grating, passes through a first pupil partial region in an effective region of the pupil and so that a −first-order diffracted beam, generated through the diffraction grating, passes through a second pupil partial region, and a measuring unit which measures an intensity of the +first-order diffracted beam, and an intensity of the −first-order diffracted beam, and the measuring apparatus determines a ratio of a pupil transmittance in the first and second pupil partial regions.
