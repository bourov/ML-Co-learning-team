A reticle is loaded on a reticle measuring instrument (step S50), and the surface shape of the reticle in a state held by a reticle holder of the reticle measuring instrument is measured in advance (step S52). Because the surface shape difference between the reticle holder of the reticle measuring instrument and a reticle holder of an exposure apparatus is known, the surface shape of the reticle in a state equivalent to the state held by the reticle holder of the exposure apparatus can be calculated (step S56) by adding to the measurement results such surface shape difference.
