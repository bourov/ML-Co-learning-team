US20100020302A1 - Projection exposure tool for microlithography with a measuring apparatus and method for measuring an irradiation strength distribution 
A projection exposure tool (10) for microlithography with a measuring apparatus (36) disposed in an optical path (28) of the projection exposure tool (10) for the locally and angularly resolved measurement of an irradiation strength distribution. The measuring apparatus (36) includes a measuring field with an arrangement (56) of focusing optical elements (42) disposed at respective individual points of the measuring field (41), a common image plane (44) for the focusing optical elements (42), a locally resolving radiation detector (46) with a recording surface (48) for the locally resolved recording of a radiation intensity, the recording surface (48) being disposed in the common image plane (44), and the radiation detector outputting radiation intensity signals for a plurality of angle values indicative of a respective angularly resolved irradiation strength distribution for at least one of the individual measuring field points.
